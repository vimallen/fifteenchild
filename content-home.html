<h2>Welcome to Samuel Tweed Fabrics, the home of luxury mohair.</h2>
Samuel Tweed Fabrics have been designing and manufacturing fabric for over 75 years. Since the mid 1950s our apparel fabrics have been shipped to the top fashion houses of Europe and in the 1970s, mohair, the most regal of fibres, was introduced. The name Samuel Tweed has been synonymous with luxury mohair ever since.

The collection is still designed and woven to the highest of standards in the UK and our customer base now covers the entire globe. Mohair is soft, lustrous and durable; warm in winter yet cool in summer and takes colour magnificently. Samuel Tweed mohair is all about colour, vibrant textures, natural softness and warmth without weight.

Our collection for A/W 16/17 is worked into four exciting colour and design stories: <a href="http://localhost:8888/tweedfifteen/beautify/">Beautify</a>, <a href="http://localhost:8888/tweedfifteen/passion/">Passion</a>, <a href="http://localhost:8888/tweedfifteen/sobriety/">Sobriety</a> and <a href="http://localhost:8888/tweedfifteen/wilderness/">Wilderness</a>. Take a look.
